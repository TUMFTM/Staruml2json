# Tutorial

In this tutorial we go through the minimal example to use staruml2json converter.

## Preparation
Get yourself an installation of [Staruml](http://staruml.io/), which can be evaluated for free. Staruml is available for Windows and Linux. We presume V3 in this tutorial. <br>
Make yourself familiar with the syntax of this tool (described on [mainpage](https://github.com/TUMFTM/Staruml2json)).

## Step 1: Create a meta model
A meta model can use classes and relations between the classes. Relations can be of type Aggregation/Composition/Relation. Furthermore we can use inheritance to as well known from object oriented workflows.
As a minimum, we need one class to establish the meta model.

## Step 2: Model inferred from meta model
- object
- links: structural and defining
- set custom values as slots

## Step 3: Convert to json
as described in the mainpage

## Step 4: Work with the result
- inspect json
- import to mongo or dynamo
